# nabu-3 Composer install package
## Dependencies
nabu-3 is built over linux and PHP-7.1. Dependencies are checked and required when you install each module using composer. The basic installation runs well over PHP-7.0, but if you plan to use some modules like [nabu-3 QRCode](https://github.com/nabu-3/provider-nabu-qrcode), you need to run nabu-3 under PHP-7.1.

We recommend to run nabu-3 always over PHP-7.1.

## Install
To install nabu-3 in your computer, please run the command below in /opt folder:
```sh
composer create-project nabu-3/nabu-3 nabu-3
```
